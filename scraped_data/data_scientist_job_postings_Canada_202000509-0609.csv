Data Scientist,CA$89k-CA$100k (Glassdoor Est.),26d,"Wanted: An eagle-eyed Data Scientist who will help us transform customer data into actionable insight

PN is looking for an ambitious, persuasive data scientist who’s passionate about health, fitness and helping people live their best life.

Precision Nutrition is growing, and we need a results-driven data scientist to mine our customer data, develop analysis and deliver recommendations to digital marketing and product groups. As one of the largest nutrition coaching companies in the world, PN is bigger than it’s ever been — and it’s about to get bigger.

To help us scale, we need a data scientist who knows how to synthesize data into plain English so we can help millions more people live healthier, happier lives.

Join our Adventure

We’re embarking on a new adventure, and we need a multi-talented data scientist to drive the analysis that strengthens our product offers

We’ve got an exciting journey ahead of us… Over the next 10 years, Precision Nutrition will be expanding its world-class education and coaching services into a wide range of new fields, including yoga, group exercise, sports coaching, athletics, manual therapy and more.

To help us reach our goals and keep us moving forward, we need a data scientist who knows how to distill complex data into actionable steps—and communicate it to the right people.

Who we’re looking for

A shrewd data hound with the ability to communicate clearly

You’re naturally curious. You have an inquisitive mind, and you’re always looking for hard numbers to uncover patterns and insights in the way people think and work. You want to know what makes people tick, and gaining a deep understanding of your customers drives you to develop innovative solutions to solve their problems.

You’re self-motivated. Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don’t need a lot of direction. You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges. At the same time, you don’t silo yourself, and are always eager to learn more and share with the team.

You’re results-driven and have a strong bias for action. You get energized by developing recommendations that improve our product, and you excel at understanding and optimizing the journey our customers go through. You excel at knowing how to prioritize, adapt quickly when the scope changes—because it often will—and juggle lots of moving parts.

You’re a confident decision maker. Since you’ll be collaborating with people across the organization, you’ll be taking in a lot of competing input and synthesizing that into a specific course of action. You aren’t afraid to take on the authority and accountability needed to make a decision and drive the plan forward in the way you think will have the biggest effect. You don’t water down the plan to please everyone.

You’re an excellent communicator. You know how to say it, write it and present it in both layman’s terms and a bit more formally if needed. You know how to be heard and energize people around you, even when you’re “managing up” and presenting recommendations to the board.

You’re a motivating, team-oriented, people person. Let’s face it, in order to get other people to execute on your projects, you must be able to easily build relationships and credibility. You earn and give respect so that you can collaborate with the team and persuade the right people of your recommendations. Oh, and since you get to do all of this remotely, from the comfort of your home, and you won’t be going into an office every day to wrangle the team—so your people and leadership skills are truly first class.

What you’ll be doing

Seeking constant opportunities to make our product offerings better

You’re the navigator, deciphering the map and telling the captains the best course to their destination.

Your mission is simple: comb through customer data to find the best areas for improvement, and relay that to the business side of the company. That means:
Building and monitoring metrics. You’ll work through requirements for surveys and dashboards, and monitor KPIs over time to identify trends and build models that explain how our customers interact with our organization and use our product.
Collaborating with the data and analytics group. On the other end of things, you’ll also help set up and automate data collection and aggregation to support analytical needs.
Presenting to stakeholders. Once you identify areas for improvement, you’ll need to present your case to the marketing or product team, explaining what the data tells us and how to make that campaign or product feature better (or discussing possible areas we need to dig deeper).
A few important caveats

This is a dream job, if you’re the right person for it.

Must-Have #1: You must be experienced. We’re looking for someone with 3-5 years of experience in a data scientist position, ideally with a degree in math, stats, or computer science. You must have a demonstrated track record of going from data exploration to analysis and presentation of recommended actions that resulted in a business improvement.

Must-Have #2: You must know the tools of the trade. You have a solid understanding of data manipulation and visualization, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, and customer segmentation—and the tools that go along with those. You can develop visualization dashboards in reporting tools such as Tableau like a pro, and you have experience with data science tools like Heap, Panda, SciKit, and others, as well as manipulate and analyze data in SQL and Python.

Must-Have #3: You must be comfortable collaborating and communicating. Your job extends beyond analyzing the numbers, so you’ll need to be just as comfortable presenting recommendations to others as you are digging through data on your own. In particular, you excel at translating technical concepts into business-driven advice.

Wondering if this is the right path for you?

Every year, professionals at the top of their field choose to join Precision Nutrition.

Here are some reasons why.

Reason #1: We give you the freedom to “do you.”

Unlike most companies, we don’t have rigid rules about how and when to do things. You’ll always be free to work independently, whenever, wherever, and however you want -- without the bureaucracy and office politics.

Reason #2: You can work from anywhere.

We’re a 100% remote company, and have been working remote for 17 years. We’re ideally looking for candidates in Canada, but will consider the US as well. When you join our team, you’re no longer shackled to one desk in one office!

Reason #3: Meetings are optional. (No, really.)

You’re an adult. You’re capable of deciding how your time should be spent. If you don’t think you need to attend a meeting, you don’t. Simple as that.

Reason #4: You’ll always feel supported.

In a regular office, it’s easy to feel like a hamster in a wheel, powerless to change things. At Precision Nutrition, we work as a team to overcome issues & barriers that stand in each other’s way, and we treat each other with enthusiasm, compassion, and care.

Reason #5: You’ll never be bored.

People often come to Precision Nutrition after hitting a plateau in their old jobs. At PN, you’ll get the chance to chart new territories in your space, conquer new challenges, learn from the best, and reach thrilling new heights of personal and professional growth.

Reason #6: You’re free to be you.

At Precision Nutrition, we want everyone to live healthier, happier lives—no matter your race, age, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. That's why diversity is a key ingredient of our workforce, so we can best represent the people we serve. Everyone is welcome—as an inclusive workplace, we want our employees to bring their authentic whole selves to work. Be you.

Reason #7: You’ll have autonomy.

Not every data scientist job allows you time in the driver’s seat, but with this position, you’ll be taking charge of the analytical projects related to our product, and even make up your own projects that help make us better. You’ll never be bored by the range of tasks you get to work on.

Plus: no commute ... and no 9-to-5 grind.

KoBold Metals is using machine learning, and other scientific computing techniques, to explore for the critical materials needed to build electric vehicles and personal electronics. Our data platform, TerraShed™, aggregates and integrates vast collections of scientific data from around the world. We use the data in TerraShed™ to predict the locations of compositional anomalies and to rigorously quantify how new data can decrease the uncertainty of our predictions. These models – our Machine Prospector™ software – incorporate this value-of-information framework to guide our decisions of where to acquire land and what field data to collect, from geochemical sampling to airborne surveys to drilling campaigns.

As electric vehicles become widespread, many new mines will be needed; but before new deposits can be mined, they have to be discovered. Our objective is to find new ore deposits rich in critical battery materials. KoBold’s team combines the world’s top mineral explorers with an outstanding team of data scientists and software engineers. We are building a portfolio of assets, and we will monetize those assets after increasing the value through discovery and definition of resources and reserves.

Find insights in unstructured data and work with the engineering team to ingest and extract key features from these datasets
Build models to predict the locations of mineral ore deposits
Create effective visualizations for evaluating model performance and enabling rapid interaction with the underlying data and key features
Support the exploration team with various custom geospatial analyses
Qualifications

A great Data Scientist candidate will have:
Proficiency in Python, including both data science packages and general software development
Proficiency in SQL and familiarity with non-relational databases
A technical stack that includes most or all of: Python, Postgres/PostGIS, GIS, Tensorflow, git
Experience building a wide variety of predictive models, applying them to different problems, and evaluating and interpreting the results
Experience working with a broad range of types of data and the inconsistencies and measurement errors that arise from field and laboratory measurements of physical properties
Broad skills in applied statistics
At least 3 years of relevant full-time professional work experience as a data scientist
The ability to work well with technical experts who aren’t software people
Excitement about joining a fast-growing early-stage company, comfort with a dynamic work environment, and eagerness to take on a range of responsibilities
Enjoyment in getting the details right

It is helpful but not required to have:

(Associate / Senior / Principal) Statistical Scientist / Statistician,CA$48k-CA$80k (Glassdoor Est.),24h,"Due to the continued growth of our pipeline we have opportunities for an exceptional statistician (s) at multiple levels to join our Biostatistics group.

As a Biostatistician at Roche you will be a key strategic partner in multi-disciplinary teams, working with colleagues based both locally and globally developing drugs in Phase 1 to 3 trials.

For those with existing experience you will be responsible for providing drug development and statistical expertise to the design and analysis of clinical studies which may extend to the entire global development program. You may also be responsible for providing statistical input to teams preparing for health authority submissions, leadership of other statisticians and related colleagues in health authority activities and participating in health authority interactions.

For those without (or more limited) direct experience of designing and analysing clinical trials we would be interested to learn about how your existing skills and other experience (e.g. during your degree) could be of use at Roche. In return, we will be able to provide you with full training and support to develop your career as a Biostatistician at Roche.

This is an opportunity to own your career development and be actively encouraged and supported through continual learning opportunities (including courses, local & global statistical and other scientific seminars, potential part-time study and rotations into related departments, two conferences per year, membership of industry/academic working groups such as through PSI).

You will be encouraged to pursue applied research on drug development opportunities and challenges as a continued part of your role, either alongside your project work or even as a formal rotation into our statistical methodology group. You will be given the freedom to discuss ideas and collaborate with over 200 Biostatisticians within Roche and other Data Scientists on drug development opportunities/challenges, as well as with key academics with whom we have consultancy arrangements.

Qualifications

You have qualifications that have given you the strong basis for your career so far (e.g. MSc or PhD in Statistics or related discipline) coupled with a programming language (e.g. SAS, R) that allows you to evaluate assumptions when designing clinical trials and then model/ explore data arising from clinical trials.

For the more senior roles you will need to have experience of study design and data analysis from different phases of drug development. You may also have experience in specialist areas such as analysis of biomarker data. For previous vacancies we’ve had success appointing statisticians from a range of backgrounds (e.g. academic settings, clinical research groups, CROs) so your own experience could have been gained outside of the traditional pharmaceutical industry.

Depending on your previous experience, you may have a good understanding of regulatory guidelines in drug development and have experience of participating or leading a team or sub-team working on a submission to a HA or HTA agency. It is also desirable that you have demonstrated leadership potential by leading such a team or sub-team.

To be successful in all of these roles you will need to provide evidence of conducting statistical research through your qualifications or current position.

We are keen to hear from those who have performed novel statistical work (perhaps unpublished) that has provided innovative approaches for your drug project team to consider. For those without drug development experience, we are keen to hear how you have pursued novel methodology (possibly as part of your university degree) and how such research may be applied in practice. You want to take on a role in a company that will provide you with opportunities and support, but then leave you to get on and make the most of those opportunities globally.

If you have some, but not all, of the above experience but believe that the global expertise of the Roche/Genentech people and the depth of the portfolio could be a place at which you could excel, then we’d very much like to hear what you have to offer.

Roche is currently supporting statisticians to pursue a PhD on a part-time basis, so would be interested to talk with you if you are doing likewise or considering this.

Our award-winning office, known as Hexagon Place, was opened in 2005 and provides a modern, flexible working environment with facilities that are second-to-none. Around 2,000 people work at our Welwyn office in Early Development (pRED), Product Development (PD), Commercial (Rx) and of course our Corporate functions.

There is a fully equipped gym on-site, a library and information centre, and an active sports and social club. We also have a subsidised staff restaurant providing foods to cater for every taste throughout the day. At the heart of the building is an informal meeting area known as The Street which features a coffee shop, snack machine and cashpoint. A second building on-site, called The Hub, contains modern meeting room and conference facilities.

If you are proud of contributing and feel you have the commitment to teamwork and innovation that we are seeking, then Roche is the organisation for you. In return we offer a competitive salary plus the excellent benefits you would expect from a blue-chip organisation, including a genuine interest in your development and progression.

Chef de file mondial de l'intelligence artificielle, Element AI poursuit un objectif commun, celui d'utiliser nos vastes capacités de recherche pour développer des produits et logiciels d'IA offrant des solutions aux problèmes complexes auxquels font face les entreprises et la société en général.

Nous croyons que l'être humain doit toujours rester au cœur de tout ce que nous faisons. C'est pourquoi nous avons adopté une approche collaborative et humaine, afin que nos objectifs restent toujours éthiques et ancrés dans le réel.

L'équipe d'analyse chronologique est un équipe d'experts interdisciplinaire dont le mandat est de développer des outils basés sur l'apprentissage automatique et l'intelligence artificielle pour résoudre des problèmes industriels complexes dans les domaines des prévisions fondées sur l'analyse chronologique, de la détection d'anomalies temporelles et séquentielles, des systèmes de recommandation temporels, de la modélisation spatiotemporelle, des analyses de type « temps avant événement » et plusieurs autres.

Ce que vous ferez :

Confronté à des problèmes concrets et des jeux de données réels, vous devrez mettre à profit votre expertise et votre créativité pour appliquer les méthodes existantes (et en développer de nouvelles) afin de trouver des solutions pratiques et flexibles. Vous serez appelé à contribuer à l'évaluation de différentes possibilités et partager vos idées et vos commentaires concernant la conception des produits. Vous devrez donc évaluer et comprendre les besoins des clients (internes ou externes) pour les traduire en solutions pertinentes et applicables.

Vous devrez en outre effectuer la recherche nécessaire pour proposer des modèles et techniques appropriés et démontrer l'expertise pour mettre en place et former les modèles vous-même. Lorsque pertinent, vous n'hésiterez pas à appliquer les méthodes classiques d'apprentissage automatique, mais vous êtes également prêts à innover et repousser les frontières de l'apprentissage automatique, de l'apprentissage profond et de l'IA.

Finalement, vous devrez comprendre et accepter que la valeur de votre travail se reflète dans son impact sur l'utilisateur final de nos produits; trouver des façons de mesurer cet impact doit faire partie intégrante de votre mission.

Profil recherché :

Vous avez une expérience considérable en modélisation et en analyse chronologiques, soit en prévision en détection des anomalies. Vous avez une connaissance approfondie ou un intérêt marqué pour la théorie derrière l'apprentissage automatique et d'autres domaines de l'IA, acquise au fil de vos études, de votre expérience dans l'industrie et de projets personnels sensationnels. Vous êtes à l'aise à exprimer vos idées sous forme de code et n'avez pas peur de vous retrousser les manches et contribuer aux tâches de programmation et d'ingénierie.

Vous comprenez que de tester un modèle avec les données variées et excessives associées à un contexte commercial est différent que de le tester dans un contexte académique « propre » — vous savez que de modifier un modèle ou une technique dans un tel environnement peut représenter un défi de taille. Cela ne vous effraie pas, vous avez peut-être même de l'expérience avec ce genre de défis.

Vous apprenez de manière autonome et vous êtes toujours à l'affût des plus récentes découvertes et techniques dans votre domaine; vous êtes motivé à participer aux différentes occasions d'apprentissage que nous offrons.

Le ou la candidat(e) idéal(e) aura de l'expérience ou de bonnes connaissances touchant à un vaste éventail de sujets : modélisation chronologique, nettoyage de données, répartition, ingénierie de fonctionnalités, processus stochastiques, modèles chronologiques classiques, techniques d'apprentissage automatique pour les problèmes de régression, etc. Si vous avez déjà résolu un problème de prévision chronologique de A à Z – vous serez à votre place dans notre équipe!

Ce que nous vous offrons :
Faites équipe avec d'autres passionnés de l'IA;
Profitez d'un excellent équilibre travail-vie;
Laissez votre marque dans une industrie en plein essor;
Déployez votre talent pour affronter de nouveaux défis chaque jour;
Vous serez étonné de tout ce que vous apprendrez;
Culture d'entreprise ouverte et inclusive.

Element AI is one of the world's largest artificial intelligence companies, with a shared goal of using our extensive research to develop AI products and software that will solve some of the most challenging issues facing businesses and society as a whole.

We are founded on the belief that humans should be at the heart of everything we do, and have adopted a people-first and collaborative mindset to ensure we collectively drive real and ethically-sound results.

The AI Core Time Series team is a cross-disciplinary team of experts that develops Machine Learning-based and AI-based tools for solving complex industrial problems in the fields of time series forecasting, temporal and sequential anomaly detection, temporal recommendation systems, spatio-temporal modelling, time-to-event, and the like.

What you'll do:

You will be confronted with real-world challenges and datasets, and you will need to use your expertise and creativity to apply existing methods and develop new ones to solve these problems in a practical and scalable way. You will be called upon to assess possibilities and provide ideas and input into product design choices. This will involve understanding your customer (internal or external) needs and translating them into solutions that address those needs.

You will be expected to both do the necessary research to propose appropriate models/techniques and to have the necessary expertise to implement and train the models yourself. Where useful, you will not hesitate to employ classical forecasting methods, but you are enthusiastic about the idea of pushing the boundaries of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI.

Finally, you will be expected to embrace the fact that the value of your work is ultimately reflected in the impact it has on the end-customers using our products and to find ways of measuring that impact as an integral part of your mission.

What we're looking for:

You have significant experience with time series modelling and analysis from either a forecasting or anomaly detection perspective. You also have an understanding or significant interest in the underlying theory of machine learning or related AI field. This expertise can come from extensive studies, previous industrial experience or awesome self-taught projects you have done on a personal basis. You are comfortable expressing ideas into code and do not mind getting your hands dirty in various coding and engineering tasks.

You understand that running a model on the varied and often noisy data that arise in a commercial context differs significantly from running it on a clean academic dataset and that modifying a model or technique to work in that setting can be a significant and sometimes frustrating challenge. You embrace this challenge and may even have previous experience tackling it.

You learn autonomously and will enthusiastically stay up to date with the literature and techniques of your field while participating in the various learning opportunities we offer.

The ideal candidate would have experience or familiarity with topics such as time series modelling and analysis, data cleaning, imputation, feature engineering, stochastic processes, various classical time series models, machine learning techniques for regression problems. If you have experience solving a time series forecasting problem end to end, then you'll fit right in!

What we offer for your valuable work:
Work closely with other AI enthusiasts;
Enjoy your work and life harmony;
Leave your mark in a thriving industry;
Apply your talent to tackling new challenges everyday;
Be surprised at how much you will learn;
Open and inclusive company culture.

At Coveo, it is our constant obsession to find out innovative ways to put our customer's data to work for them. Luckily for us, said customers are pouring in an ever increasing volume of that primordial data which allows our teams to have a lot of material to work with. But all that data is difficult to collect and even more challenging to make sense of without the right data platform. And that is where you come in as a premier data engineer!

What a typical day looks like:
You start your day with a good coffee, reading news about some new stream processing library Netflix has recently released to enable more efficient pipelines. You take a few notes to discuss with your colleagues at the scrum.
After the scrum, you get to work with the In-Product experience team to define the data format and implement a new data pipeline to gather, analyse and learn from all interactions happening in their clients applications. Based on the client's metrics, you estimate the load at several millions of events daily, so you work hard on optimizing and load testing the new data pipeline.
You get to chat with Mike as you go fill your water bottle: the data pipeline you've set for the ML team a month ago really made the data scientists' lives easier. High-fives all around for that!
You get to lunch, and the team wanted to watch the streaming of a presentation of a new AWS feature coming up that might provide new options to scale our platform.
Back to your desk (or some other location) to continue working on the development of the new in-product experience data pipeline using the latest streaming and data processing technologies.
You show your design, submit your code and the results of the tests for review by your colleagues. Great work: the new pipeline can transform hundreds of millions of events daily in real-time without problems.
A new big client is being on boarded by the Commerce team, and they would like to make sure that all the events have been integrated properly. You take a look at what happens under the hood to make sure everything is flawless!
A member of the Usage Analytics team has a question about the dataset she wants to extract and more specifically how to get the right columns for an analysis she is working on. You take a quick 10 min to discuss with her, and then get back to your code.

What is expected of you:
As a Data Engineer at Coveo, we'll encourage you to innovate, and share ideas on a daily basis. We are looking for candidates with at least 3 years of working experience. Some of the core expertise we're looking for:

Extensive knowledge of SQL.
Experience with Kafka, Kinesis or other streaming platforms.
Experience in Data Lake Architecture, and high volume real-time streaming.

Principal Applied Research Scientist,CA$78k-CA$127k (Glassdoor Est.),4d,"Dialogue's purpose is to improve humanity's well-being by using technology to deliver great care. In just a couple of years, we've established ourselves as a Canadian leader in virtual care, but we're just getting started on our journey.

We are looking for a Principal Applied Research Scientist, to join a talented multi-functional engineering and research team and focus on building the next generation of systems that will power the future of Dialogue.

About our technology


Dialogue's service runs on apps for patients and health-care providers. Behind beautifully-crafted user interfaces is the infrastructure of services built to allow us to scale while delivering an amazing experience for our members. ML systems are critical to both, scale and member experience.

Dialogue's back-end is architected as a set of micro-services, mostly written in Python, deployed on Kubernetes clusters, on AWS. The ML pipeline uses MLflow. One sub-system we've been investing a lot is a bot framework based on the Rasa platform. Our bots are built as human-in-the-loop systems, allowing healthcare providers to focus on what they do best; and leave other tasks to bots. This architecture helps us to create unique and high-quality datasets.

One of the bots we develop helps us evaluate the patient by collecting the relevant medical information. It has a medical NLU layer based on SpaCy and TensorFlow. We have a structured knowledge graph of medical concepts and an inference engine that recognizes hundreds of medical conditions by understanding over a thousand different symptoms and risk factors.

Another key system is a recommendation engine designed to determine the right next step for the patient's journey depending on a specific case.

What will you do


You'll work directly with the CTO, extended product and engineering teams to understand business priorities, challenges and the opportunities ahead.

Who we are:

http://www.rideco.com

RideCo powers on-demand transit. Public transit agencies use RideCo's cloud-based software platform to provide on-demand shared rides in dynamically routed buses, vans, and cars. Our clients include some of the world’s largest transportation operators such as San Antonio Metro, Los Angeles Metro, San Diego County, Grab, and Calgary Transit.

Have you experienced getting frustrated with transfers and waiting while taking a public bus? Have you seen buses drive around in low-density areas with very few passengers on-board and wondered how inefficient that seems to be? You're likely aware of the first & last mile access challenges faced by transit hubs. We are solving these problems by re-imagining shared mobility. Imagine a world where vehicles have dynamic routes responsive to real-time trip demand. This 'dynamic shuttle' (or van/sedan) would pick you up, on-demand, at or near your doorstep and take you to your destination or transit hub. Along the way, it may pick-up other passengers going in your direction. Your experience will be seamless: less waiting, less walking, fewer transfers, shorter travel time, and timely pickups and drop-offs. RideCo's 'dynamic shuttle' platform enables this seamless experience and low-cost shared rides for vehicle fleet operators and their passengers. By seamlessly moving more people in fewer vehicles we are catalyzing a generational shift in how people get around cities and towns. This means commuters spend less time in transit and more time doing what they enjoy.

RideCo powers a diverse range of use cases, including residential/ suburban travel; first-mile-last-mile connections for transit hubs; and corporate employee transportation. We are investing to scale up and capture the growing demand for on-demand shared rides solutions.

Data Engineer,CA$71k-CA$121k (Glassdoor Est.),6d,"Delivering a strong foundation for our data-driven teams

At Coveo, it is our constant obsession to find out innovative ways to put our customer's data to work for them. Luckily for us, said customers are pouring in an ever increasing volume of that primordial data which allows our teams to have a lot of material to work with. But all that data is difficult to collect and even more challenging to make sense of without the right data platform. And that is where you come in as a premier data engineer!

What a typical day looks like:
You start your day with a good coffee, reading news about some new stream processing library Netflix has recently released to enable more efficient pipelines. You take a few notes to discuss with your colleagues at the scrum.
After the scrum, you get to work with the In-Product experience team to define the data format and implement a new data pipeline to gather, analyse and learn from all interactions happening in their clients applications. Based on the client's metrics, you estimate the load at several millions of events daily, so you work hard on optimizing and load testing the new data pipeline.
You get to chat with Mike as you go fill your water bottle: the data pipeline you've set for the ML team a month ago really made the data scientists' lives easier. High-fives all around for that!
You get to lunch, and the team wanted to watch the streaming of a presentation of a new AWS feature coming up that might provide new options to scale our platform.
Back to your desk (or some other location) to continue working on the development of the new in-product experience data pipeline using the latest streaming and data processing technologies.
You show your design, submit your code and the results of the tests for review by your colleagues. Great work: the new pipeline can transform hundreds of millions of events daily in real-time without problems.
A new big client is being on boarded by the Commerce team, and they would like to make sure that all the events have been integrated properly. You take a look at what happens under the hood to make sure everything is flawless!
A member of the Usage Analytics team has a question about the dataset she wants to extract and more specifically how to get the right columns for an analysis she is working on. You take a quick 10 min to discuss with her, and then get back to your code.

What is expected of you:
As a Data Engineer at Coveo, we'll encourage you to innovate, and share ideas on a daily basis. We are looking for candidates with at least 3 years of working experience. Some of the core expertise we're looking for:

Extensive knowledge of SQL.
Experience with Kafka, Kinesis or other streaming platforms.
Experience in Data Lake Architecture, and high volume real-time streaming.
Experience in distributed computing and big data.
Knowledge of data warehouses like Redshift or Snowflake.
Knowledge of best practices in CI/CD, as well as in DevSecOps.

Summer Position

""So, you're an Economics major...what are you going to do with that?""

When I was a student, I got that question on a weekly basis. If you are an Economics, Math, or Statistics major, then I'm sure you've been asked a similar question. What are you doing with your life?

Chances are you are a nerd. You can't just get in a car and drive; you spend at least 30 seconds calculating the optimal route to get you where you need to go quickly and efficiently. Where others get overwhelmed with a spreadsheet of numbers, you get excited to find the story the numbers tell.

But there's more to you than numbers. You enjoy thinking creatively. You are passionate and ambitious in your own way. You live a calculated life....but you're going to calculate your way to the top.

On the other hand, maybe you are a BCOMM major who hates the ""fluff"" of marketing and likes digging into the numbers, the research, the nitty-gritty of it all. You realize that a marketing campaign is only as good as the results that come from it.

If you are an active post-secondary student and can relate to any or all of this, then we have an opportunity with your name all over it.

But first, you should know my story. I thought I would end up being some sort of analyst for a business somewhere. I was looking for internships when I found one in digital marketing. Digital marketing? Isn't that those annoying, flashing ads that follow me around the internet? No thank you.

Fortunately, my GPA wasn't high enough for anything ""prestigious"" so I tried it out. Best. Decision. Ever. The data at my fingertips was just begging to be analyzed. I could run hundreds of experiments simultaneously that provided actionable insights. The best part? I didn't just hand those insights off to management - I got to use them to optimize campaigns myself and make a real difference for dozens of businesses in different industries.

The people I worked with were young, fun, and passionate (but still nerds...like me).

Oh, and I didn't have anything to do with annoying, flashing ads. It's all about relevant, helpful content in front of the right customer at the right time.

This type of work may be perfect for you. Maybe not. Either way, I want to provide a golden opportunity for you to try it.

We have an opportunity that could provide you the perfect environment to apply your education and natural curiosity to the world of digital marketing and grow your professional portfolio.

Why wait to graduate to build your experience? We have a full-time summer position opportunity with the potential to continue into the school year on a part-time casual basis.

We're looking for someone to join our team and to do the following:
Learn Google AdWords & Facebook Ads, the top digital marketing platforms available
Apply your beautiful, analytical brain to assigned accounts to help increase revenue and decrease costs in advertising

Principal Applied Research Scientist,CA$71k-CA$121k (Glassdoor Est.),11d,"Dialogue's purpose is to improve humanity's well-being by using technology to deliver great care. In just a couple of years, we've established ourselves as a Canadian leader in virtual care, but we're just getting started on our journey.

We are looking for a Principal Applied Research Scientist, to join a talented multi-functional engineering and research team and focus on building the next generation of systems that will power the future of Dialogue.

About our technology


Dialogue's service runs on apps for patients and health-care providers. Behind beautifully-crafted user interfaces is the infrastructure of services built to allow us to scale while delivering an amazing experience for our members. ML systems are critical to both, scale and member experience.

Dialogue's back-end is architected as a set of micro-services, mostly written in Python, deployed on Kubernetes clusters, on AWS. The ML pipeline uses MLflow. One sub-system we've been investing a lot is a bot framework based on the Rasa platform. Our bots are built as human-in-the-loop systems, allowing healthcare providers to focus on what they do best; and leave other tasks to bots. This architecture helps us to create unique and high-quality datasets.

One of the bots we develop helps us evaluate the patient by collecting the relevant medical information. It has a medical NLU layer based on SpaCy and TensorFlow. We have a structured knowledge graph of medical concepts and an inference engine that recognizes hundreds of medical conditions by understanding over a thousand different symptoms and risk factors.

Another key system is a recommendation engine designed to determine the right next step for the patient's journey depending on a specific case.

What will you do


You'll work directly with the CTO, extended product and engineering teams to understand business priorities, challenges and the opportunities ahead. You'll then lead the research team to identify the most promising areas where ML systems can make the biggest impact. You'll put in place the right process for an applied research project to take models from the proof of concept all the way to production. You'll collaborate with the engineering and data science teams to make sure the research team has the right resources to succeed and to assure that the results of your research are integrated within the production system.

Even though management is a part of this role, most of your time will be focused on the applied research.

You'll perform data analysis to deeply understand the datasets of Dialogue and to shape their evolution. You'll work with a unique healthcare dataset including structured events, natural language, conversations, audio, images. You'll collaborate closely with experts in the medical field that can help improve models and generate more data.

You'll engage with the research community around the variety of topics relevant to your work, publish the results of your research and may contribute to an open-source project.

You'll develop the models and experiments, then write the code that will be pushed to production.

Who are we looking for


We're looking for someone who combines the extensive background in ML with a strong interest in building products and applying the results of their research.

You have a strong theoretical understanding of ML fundamentals and have developed good intuition about what approach could work best given the task at hand.

You have years of professional experience as a research scientist, data scientist or a software engineer. You are very comfortable with Python and modern ML tools. You have built production systems and/or published the results of your research.

Last but certainly not least, we're looking for someone who shares Dialogue values. To learn more about us, check out dialogue.co.

What we offer


Dialogue is fortunate to have the support needed to tackle such an ambitious goal and offer competitive compensation. All Dialogue employees are also equity holders, and you won't be an exception. Our health benefits are some of the best you can find, plus they're 100% funded by the company.

Other information

The Public Service of Canada is committed to building a skilled and diverse workforce that reflects the Canadians we serve. We promote employment equity and encourage you to indicate if you belong to one of the designated groups when you apply.

Information on employment equity

You must meet all essential qualifications in order to be appointed to the position. Other qualifications may be a deciding factor in choosing the person to be appointed. Some essential and other qualifications will be assessed through your application. It is your responsibility to provide appropriate examples that illustrate how you meet each qualification. Failing to do so could result in your application being rejected.

When answering the screening questions, the assessment board cannot make assumptions about your experience. It is insufficient to say that you have the required qualifications or to list your current or past duties. Rather, candidates must demonstrate how they meet the education and experience criteria listed in the job opportunity advertisement by providing clear and concrete examples.

Clear and concrete examples are defined as illustrations in which you fully explain the actions, considerations and steps you completed in order to gain the experience you are describing. This detailed, contextual information will be used by the board members reviewing your submission to assess whether you have sufficient experience in a relevant field. This is similar to what would be expected if you were asked to provide a concrete example of a particular situation in an interview. Such examples usually require a minimum of ½ page to describe and a maximum of 2 pages. In order to facilitate this process, you may wish to start your submissions with a sentence similar to: ""A clear and concrete example of a situation where I did X is a situation which occurred on Y date and my role in this activity was to..."".

Resumes will be used as a secondary source of information and to strictly validate the concrete examples you will have described in this tool.

Also, when reading the experience criteria for staffing processes, please pay close attention to action words contained within and ensure the examples you choose pertain to all of them. Similar attention should be given to punctuation and connector words such as ""commas"", ""and"" and ""or"" as these have a different function when used to describe an experience criteria. As such, action words or activities separated with a "","" and connected with an ""and"" must all be demonstrated with concrete examples as in this case, they are all deemed essential by the hiring manager. Conversely, when action words or activities are separated with a "","" and connected with an ""or"", candidates may provide concrete examples for only one of the activities listed in the criterion since.

For example, when responding to a criterion which reads: ""Experience reading, writing and publishing instructions for a competitive process."" you must provide concrete examples of situations where you read instructions, concrete examples of situations where you wrote instructions as well as concrete examples of situations where you published instructions for a competitive process. These may be part of the same example however, you must ensure to provide sufficient details to cover the three actions as they are all critical.

On the other hand, when responding to an experience criterion which reads: ""Experience reading, writing or publishing instructions for a competitive process"" you must provide concrete examples for a minimum of one situation where you either read, wrote or published instructions for a competitive process as experience in a minimum of one activity is critical. This being said, when this structure is used, you may also provide concrete examples for all action words or activities as this approach will provide board members with additional information to assess the breath of your experience.

Finally, if the examples you provide speak of experience that was acquired in a team setting, please be specific as to your exact role within this team as it is your experience the board will be looking to assess and not that of your team.

Reliable real-time, no missed trips, and millions of happy riders. The extra coffee probably helped ;)

Ethoca Alerts closes the information gap between card issuers and merchants, giving merchants unprecedented direct access to issuers’ cardholder-confirmed fraud intelligence.

Sunnybrook Research Institute (SRI) is seeking applications for the position of Director, Physical Sciences Platform. Applicants must hold a PhD in a relevant field (i.e. medical biophysics, bioengineering) and be eligible for appointment as a full-time Senior Scientist at SRI and as an Associate / Full Professor at the University of Toronto. We intend to nominate the selected candidate for a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair (CRC). To fill this leadership role, we are seeking an outstanding, internationally renowned researcher whose accomplishments have made a major impact in their field and is proposing to extend their work through an original, innovative research program of the highest quality at SRI. The successful candidate will have a track record of leadership with administrative experience and have a vision towards leading and growing the Physical Sciences Platform and strengthening collaborations with Biological Sciences, Evaluative Clinical Sciences and the Hospital. The Director will be expected to lead large, collaborative, cutting edge research endeavours that will yield scientific discoveries, clinical translation, commercialization and improved outcomes for patients.

About Sunnybrook Research Institute: SRI is an independent organization wholly owned by Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, one of Canada’s leading academic health sciences centres. SRI is the research enterprise for the hospital corporation and is fully affiliated with the University of Toronto. SRI has three research platforms: Biological Sciences, Evaluative Clinical Sciences and Physical Sciences, each of which functions similarly to a university department under the leadership of a cognate director. The institute supports $100 million of annual research activities within approximately 250,000 square feet of state-of-the-art research space located at the Bayview campus of Sunnybrook. SRI has one of the best recognized and most productive teams in the field of medical imaging and physical sciences research in the world. The Physical Sciences Platform is comprised of 64 scientists, and has a total staff of ~300, including close to 100 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows associated with the University of Toronto.

Research areas in Physical Sciences include Medical and Biological Imaging and Image Analysis (MRI, Ultrasound, X-Ray, Digital Pathology and Optical), Precision Medicine (Radiogenomics, Theranostics), Computational Modeling, Machine Learning, Nanomedicine, Design of Devices, Instrumentation and Interfaces, Biophysics and Bioengineering. A major focus of the Physical Sciences Platform at SRI is the field of Image Guided Therapy, reflected in support received from the Canada Foundation for Innovation leading to the establishment of the Centre for Research in Image Guided Therapeutics (CeRIGT), the FedDev-sponsored Image Guided Therapy cluster, and the current development of Inovait, an industry-academic consortium for AI and Image Guided Therapy supported by the federal Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF IV). The goal of the Physical Science Platform is to advance scientific discovery, develop new medical technologies and foster commercialization of discovery research. Our work further includes the delivery of novel diagnostic and interventional techniques to the hospital’s nine clinical programs: Holland Bone and Joint, Hurvitz Brain Sciences, Integrated Community Medicine, Odette Cancer, Schulich Heart, St. John’s Rehab, Tory Trauma, Veterans and DAN Women and Babies Programs. Scientists in this platform actively pursue opportunities to move their innovations through pre-clinical and first in human testing to commercialize the products of their research though the creation of start-ups and thought licensing, and routinely partner with many medical device companies in the development and assessment of new technologies.

The current Strategic Plan (2018-21) of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre aims to ensure that we can continue to achieve our vision of inventing the future of health care, and provide care for our patients and their families when it matters most. Our four Strategic Directions are focused on creating High Performing Teams that can develop Personalized and Precise Treatments, Integrated and Sustainable Models of Care, and Improve Quality and Create a Better Care Experience.

Responsibilities: Reporting to the Vice-President Research and Innovation, the Director will be responsible for the following: operations of the platform; strategic planning; recruitment; annual activities of research faculty; fiscal planning and accountability; and ensuring the integration of platform-based research with the strategic clinical directions of the hospital. The Director position will be initially awarded for a 5-year term, renewable following successful performance reviews, without a limit on the number of terms. The CRC is awarded for a 7-year term, renewable for a second 7-year term, contingent on a successful performance review.

You’re fluent in Python and SQL and have hands-on experience with big data technologies such as Spark and Hadoop. You love learning about new technologies whether they be in the ML or data space but are pragmatic and discerning about which technologies you adopt in your system.

You are a team player, a quick starter and an implementer who is equally comfortable talking requirements with technical product managers or getting in the zone pair programming with data scientists. Your primary focus is on shipping large-scale machine learning software systems that drive customer value by building robust and scalable computational and data-intensive workflows and web services.

Requirements
Bachelor’s degree or equivalent in Computer Science or a related field with focus in machine learning.
Strong software engineering skills and understanding of the ML lifecycle with a minimum of 3 years experience in ML and 5 years in software development.
Proficiency in Python.
Fluent in processing data with pandas and PySpark (e.g. querying, transforming, joining, cleaning, etc.) including experience debugging logic and performance issues.
Strong understanding of machine learning algorithms with experience writing, debugging and optimizing ML data structures, pipelines and transformations.
Ability to work in Linux environments with containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, Argo) and major cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure).
Nice to have:
Retail and CPG business background.
SaaS, multi-tenant and MLaaS development experience (microservice frameworks, queuing systems, event-based processing and web services).
Machine learning dev-ops experience with major cloud providers (e.g. Kubernetes, Terraform).

You are passionate about shipping large-scale software systems in a fast-paced environment but are able to balance longer term issues such as maintainability, scalability and quality. You have a strong interest and experience in machine learning having worked with machine learning and data analysis libraries such as pandas, scikit-Learn, XGBoost, lightGBM and Tensorflow but realize building a machine learning system is much more than just calling a few APIs.

You treat data as a first class citizen whether that the data comes from a data warehouse, object storage or output of a model. You’re fluent in Python and SQL and have hands-on experience with big data technologies such as Spark and Hadoop. You love learning about new technologies whether they be in the ML or data space but are pragmatic and discerning about which technologies you adopt in your system.

You are a team player, a quick starter and an implementer who is equally comfortable talking requirements with technical product managers or getting in the zone pair programming with data scientists. Your primary focus is on shipping large-scale machine learning software systems that drive customer value by building robust and scalable computational and data-intensive workflows and web services.

Requirements
Bachelor’s degree or equivalent in Computer Science or a related field with focus in machine learning.
Strong software engineering skills and understanding of the ML lifecycle with a minimum of 3 years experience in ML and 5 years in software development.
Proficiency in Python.
Fluent in processing data with pandas and PySpark (e.g. querying, transforming, joining, cleaning, etc.) including experience debugging logic and performance issues.
Strong understanding of machine learning algorithms with experience writing, debugging and optimizing ML data structures, pipelines and transformations.
Ability to work in Linux environments with containerization technologies (Docker, Kubernetes, Argo) and major cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure).
Nice to have:
Retail and CPG business background.
SaaS, multi-tenant and MLaaS development experience (microservice frameworks, queuing systems, event-based processing and web services).
Machine learning dev-ops experience with major cloud providers (e.g. Kubernetes, Terraform).
