(Associate / Senior / Principal) Statistical Scientist / Statistician,CA$80k-CA$101k (Glassdoor Est.),2d,"Due to the continued growth of our pipeline we have opportunities for an exceptional statistician (s) at multiple levels to join our Biostatistics group.

As a Biostatistician at Roche you will be a key strategic partner in multi-disciplinary teams, working with colleagues based both locally and globally developing drugs in Phase 1 to 3 trials.

For those with existing experience you will be responsible for providing drug development and statistical expertise to the design and analysis of clinical studies which may extend to the entire global development program. You may also be responsible for providing statistical input to teams preparing for health authority submissions, leadership of other statisticians and related colleagues in health authority activities and participating in health authority interactions.

For those without (or more limited) direct experience of designing and analysing clinical trials we would be interested to learn about how your existing skills and other experience (e.g. during your degree) could be of use at Roche. In return, we will be able to provide you with full training and support to develop your career as a Biostatistician at Roche.

This is an opportunity to own your career development and be actively encouraged and supported through continual learning opportunities (including courses, local & global statistical and other scientific seminars, potential part-time study and rotations into related departments, two conferences per year, membership of industry/academic working groups such as through PSI).

You will be encouraged to pursue applied research on drug development opportunities and challenges as a continued part of your role, either alongside your project work or even as a formal rotation into our statistical methodology group. You will be given the freedom to discuss ideas and collaborate with over 200 Biostatisticians within Roche and other Data Scientists on drug development opportunities/challenges, as well as with key academics with whom we have consultancy arrangements.

Qualifications

You have qualifications that have given you the strong basis for your career so far (e.g. MSc or PhD in Statistics or related discipline) coupled with a programming language (e.g. SAS, R) that allows you to evaluate assumptions when designing clinical trials and then model/ explore data arising from clinical trials.

For the more senior roles you will need to have experience of study design and data analysis from different phases of drug development. You may also have experience in specialist areas such as analysis of biomarker data. For previous vacancies we’ve had success appointing statisticians from a range of backgrounds (e.g. academic settings, clinical research groups, CROs) so your own experience could have been gained outside of the traditional pharmaceutical industry.

Depending on your previous experience, you may have a good understanding of regulatory guidelines in drug development and have experience of participating or leading a team or sub-team working on a submission to a HA or HTA agency. It is also desirable that you have demonstrated leadership potential by leading such a team or sub-team.

To be successful in all of these roles you will need to provide evidence of conducting statistical research through your qualifications or current position.

We are keen to hear from those who have performed novel statistical work (perhaps unpublished) that has provided innovative approaches for your drug project team to consider. For those without drug development experience, we are keen to hear how you have pursued novel methodology (possibly as part of your university degree) and how such research may be applied in practice. You want to take on a role in a company that will provide you with opportunities and support, but then leave you to get on and make the most of those opportunities globally.

If you have some, but not all, of the above experience but believe that the global expertise of the Roche/Genentech people and the depth of the portfolio could be a place at which you could excel, then we’d very much like to hear what you have to offer.

Roche is currently supporting statisticians to pursue a PhD on a part-time basis, so would be interested to talk with you if you are doing likewise or considering this.

Our award-winning office, known as Hexagon Place, was opened in 2005 and provides a modern, flexible working environment with facilities that are second-to-none. Around 2,000 people work at our Welwyn office in Early Development (pRED), Product Development (PD), Commercial (Rx) and of course our Corporate functions.

There is a fully equipped gym on-site, a library and information centre, and an active sports and social club. We also have a subsidised staff restaurant providing foods to cater for every taste throughout the day. At the heart of the building is an informal meeting area known as The Street which features a coffee shop, snack machine and cashpoint. A second building on-site, called The Hub, contains modern meeting room and conference facilities.

If you are proud of contributing and feel you have the commitment to teamwork and innovation that we are seeking, then Roche is the organisation for you. In return we offer a competitive salary plus the excellent benefits you would expect from a blue-chip organisation, including a genuine interest in your development and progression.

Data Scientist,CA$80k-CA$101k (Glassdoor Est.),2d,"Wanted: An eagle-eyed Data Scientist who will help us transform customer data into actionable insight

PN is looking for an ambitious, persuasive data scientist who’s passionate about health, fitness and helping people live their best life.

Precision Nutrition is growing, and we need a results-driven data scientist to mine our customer data, develop analysis and deliver recommendations to digital marketing and product groups. As one of the largest nutrition coaching companies in the world, PN is bigger than it’s ever been — and it’s about to get bigger.

To help us scale, we need a data scientist who knows how to synthesize data into plain English so we can help millions more people live healthier, happier lives.

Join our Adventure

We’re embarking on a new adventure, and we need a multi-talented data scientist to drive the analysis that strengthens our product offers

We’ve got an exciting journey ahead of us… Over the next 10 years, Precision Nutrition will be expanding its world-class education and coaching services into a wide range of new fields, including yoga, group exercise, sports coaching, athletics, manual therapy and more.

To help us reach our goals and keep us moving forward, we need a data scientist who knows how to distill complex data into actionable steps—and communicate it to the right people.

Who we’re looking for

A shrewd data hound with the ability to communicate clearly

You’re naturally curious. You have an inquisitive mind, and you’re always looking for hard numbers to uncover patterns and insights in the way people think and work. You want to know what makes people tick, and gaining a deep understanding of your customers drives you to develop innovative solutions to solve their problems.

You’re self-motivated. Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don’t need a lot of direction. You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges. At the same time, you don’t silo yourself, and are always eager to learn more and share with the team.

You’re results-driven and have a strong bias for action. You get energized by developing recommendations that improve our product, and you excel at understanding and optimizing the journey our customers go through. You excel at knowing how to prioritize, adapt quickly when the scope changes—because it often will—and juggle lots of moving parts.

You’re a confident decision maker. Since you’ll be collaborating with people across the organization, you’ll be taking in a lot of competing input and synthesizing that into a specific course of action. You aren’t afraid to take on the authority and accountability needed to make a decision and drive the plan forward in the way you think will have the biggest effect. You don’t water down the plan to please everyone.

You’re an excellent communicator. You know how to say it, write it and present it in both layman’s terms and a bit more formally if needed. You know how to be heard and energize people around you, even when you’re “managing up” and presenting recommendations to the board.

You’re a motivating, team-oriented, people person. Let’s face it, in order to get other people to execute on your projects, you must be able to easily build relationships and credibility. You earn and give respect so that you can collaborate with the team and persuade the right people of your recommendations. Oh, and since you get to do all of this remotely, from the comfort of your home, and you won’t be going into an office every day to wrangle the team—so your people and leadership skills are truly first class.

What you’ll be doing

Seeking constant opportunities to make our product offerings better

You’re the navigator, deciphering the map and telling the captains the best course to their destination.

Your mission is simple: comb through customer data to find the best areas for improvement, and relay that to the business side of the company. That means:
Building and monitoring metrics. You’ll work through requirements for surveys and dashboards, and monitor KPIs over time to identify trends and build models that explain how our customers interact with our organization and use our product.
Collaborating with the data and analytics group. On the other end of things, you’ll also help set up and automate data collection and aggregation to support analytical needs.
Presenting to stakeholders. Once you identify areas for improvement, you’ll need to present your case to the marketing or product team, explaining what the data tells us and how to make that campaign or product feature better (or discussing possible areas we need to dig deeper).
A few important caveats

This is a dream job, if you’re the right person for it.

Must-Have #1: You must be experienced. We’re looking for someone with 3-5 years of experience in a data scientist position, ideally with a degree in math, stats, or computer science. You must have a demonstrated track record of going from data exploration to analysis and presentation of recommended actions that resulted in a business improvement.

Must-Have #2: You must know the tools of the trade. You have a solid understanding of data manipulation and visualization, statistical analysis, predictive analytics, and customer segmentation—and the tools that go along with those. You can develop visualization dashboards in reporting tools such as Tableau like a pro, and you have experience with data science tools like Heap, Panda, SciKit, and others, as well as manipulate and analyze data in SQL and Python.

Must-Have #3: You must be comfortable collaborating and communicating. Your job extends beyond analyzing the numbers, so you’ll need to be just as comfortable presenting recommendations to others as you are digging through data on your own. In particular, you excel at translating technical concepts into business-driven advice.

Wondering if this is the right path for you?

Every year, professionals at the top of their field choose to join Precision Nutrition.

Here are some reasons why.

Reason #1: We give you the freedom to “do you.”

Unlike most companies, we don’t have rigid rules about how and when to do things. You’ll always be free to work independently, whenever, wherever, and however you want -- without the bureaucracy and office politics.

Reason #2: You can work from anywhere.

We’re a 100% remote company, and have been working remote for 17 years. We’re ideally looking for candidates in Canada, but will consider the US as well. When you join our team, you’re no longer shackled to one desk in one office!

Reason #3: Meetings are optional. (No, really.)

You’re an adult. You’re capable of deciding how your time should be spent. If you don’t think you need to attend a meeting, you don’t. Simple as that.

Reason #4: You’ll always feel supported.

In a regular office, it’s easy to feel like a hamster in a wheel, powerless to change things. At Precision Nutrition, we work as a team to overcome issues & barriers that stand in each other’s way, and we treat each other with enthusiasm, compassion, and care.

Reason #5: You’ll never be bored.

People often come to Precision Nutrition after hitting a plateau in their old jobs. At PN, you’ll get the chance to chart new territories in your space, conquer new challenges, learn from the best, and reach thrilling new heights of personal and professional growth.

Reason #6: You’re free to be you.

At Precision Nutrition, we want everyone to live healthier, happier lives—no matter your race, age, gender, religion, or sexual orientation. That's why diversity is a key ingredient of our workforce, so we can best represent the people we serve. Everyone is welcome—as an inclusive workplace, we want our employees to bring their authentic whole selves to work. Be you.

Reason #7: You’ll have autonomy.

Not every data scientist job allows you time in the driver’s seat, but with this position, you’ll be taking charge of the analytical projects related to our product, and even make up your own projects that help make us better. You’ll never be bored by the range of tasks you get to work on.

Plus: no commute ... and no 9-to-5 grind.

We are committed to developing the future generation of cyber scientists, analysts and professionals. And we are always keen to hear from talented and experienced people who wish to join us in our vision to be the leading cyber security advisor.

About You

You are a person who enjoys designing and implementing machine learning architectures as much as you do doing the science. You would enjoy the opportunity to build out your vision for a data science and machine learning capability in a highly technical company. You relish the challenge of unlocking the latent value in data to enable teams and organisations to succeed. You are fascinated by cyber security (even if you are not yourself a practitioner).

You want to teach machines.

You have a strong foundation in statistics and probability, can code in either Python or R, and have used at least one open-source machine-learning library or API to perform analytics. You have confidently built research-grade software and are comfortable prototyping ideas in your programming language of choice, although we’d certainly be keen to meet anyone who has pushed machine learning code into a production environment. You are familiar with large-scale data processing-relevant aspects of Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS and/or Google GCP, along with modern computing architectures.

At minimum, you have practical understanding and experience of linear models, decision trees and neural networks, possibly through industry or academia. You have used (or are interested in learning) tools/frameworks such as scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, etc.

You may also have theoretical or practical understanding of any of natural language processing, graph theory, algorithm design, or a specific research area in data science or machine learning.

This team will work on highly impactful deliverables that will be visible across both the organization as a whole. While we ask applied, real-world questions, there will be opportunities to also publish and present your work.

While this role allows for a high degree of creativity with the opportunity to strongly influence our analytics roadmap, you will be among many inspiring, collaborative, and passionate colleagues within NCC Group. With respect to applied analytics, there is already a wider community of data science professionals who would be peers at NCC Group, primarily supporting our Managed Detection & Response business located in the Netherlands.

About the Role

You will work as part of a team across NCC Group to:
Identify and understand our available data.
Design and implement our group approach to machine learning, applied analytics, and data science
Work with other departments to ensure governance, compliance and security of our data science activities.
Perform data science tasks to supply insights across teams within NCC Group.
